# Description of the assignment
My project is going to represent a ui medical interface. The project is going to give an analysis of the human body. There are different graphs displaying different information about the state of the human body. Also, there is a hover function which when you use it you can see the state of the organs. If an organ is healthy it will display blue if it is not healthy it will be displayed red.
There is a function that lets you hear the heartbeat of the human body. Furthermore, you will be able to see the location of the human body.
# Instructions
- To hear the heart beat sound press on the heart. There is a blue outline around the heart you can press anywhere inside it.
- Press 'i' to connect the heart beat to the sine wave at the top, right hand side of the screen.
- To make the sine wave which is placed in the middle of the screen visible just keep the mouse pressed. The sine wave will be displayed only if the heart beat is playing.
- Press on 'p' to make the heart beat stop. 
- Press on 'm' to make the text appear.
- Hover over the location of the 'heart', 'liver', 'stomach', 'right kidney', 'left kidney' to make them display.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
